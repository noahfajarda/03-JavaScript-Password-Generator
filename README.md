# 02-sample-portfolio-web-app

## Description

This project is an attempt to mimic a portfolio on a webplatform. Most of the items elements used within the HTML of this attempt were semantic elements (i.e. sections, navs, ps) styled with Flexbox and Media Queries. The CSS was constructed using a layout and techniques introduced in previous classes were implemented in order to create a user-friendly site that can adjust to the user's size preferences. The CSS was constructed considering the specification sematic elements and orga the layout organization to find easily accesible elements, minimize repetition, and to compartmentalize similar classes.
