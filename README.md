# 03-Code-Quiz-App

## Description

This project is an attempt to create a code quiz application where a user can answer questions within a quiz and receive, store, and retrieve their store. This application utilized various techniques used within web-apis, such as selecting, targeting, and dynamically modifying elements and utilizing local storage to retrieve and store data. This application iterates through a series of questions in which the user must select a provided answer. The user's selection will reflect whether or not time should be subtracted from a timer that is constantly ticking down as the user takes the quiz. Once the user is finished with the quiz, their score will match the timer and they have the option to store it in local storage which can be accessed while the user remains in the current session.
